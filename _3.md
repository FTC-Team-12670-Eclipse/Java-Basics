# Interface Design

## Problem
Think back to assignment2. How would you **enforce** each subclass of Pet to implement some new methods let's say eat() and sleep()?

You could try defining the methods for each subclass like this:

Dog
- methods: eat(), sleep(), ...

Bird
- methods: eat(), sleep(), ...

The problem is that Dog and Bird classes can choose not to implement eat() or sleep() methods. The user should not be allowed to create such classes.

## Solution
Think of an interface like a Contract. It's a way to say, "These classes should follow these set of rules."

Let's use an example interface and call it `IAnimal`. We could say that the interface defines two methods Run and Walk. It's a way to say, "I MUST be able to call Run, Walk, etc. on classes which implement IAnimal."

Why is this useful? You may want to build a function which relies on the fact that you must be able to call Run and Walk, for example, on the object. You could have the following:

```
public void RunThenWalk(Monkey m) {
    m.Run();
    m.Walk();
}

public void RunThenWalk(Dog d) {
    d.Run();
    d.Walk();
}
```

But the problem is that now you are repeating code for each class like Dog, Monkey, etc. With your IAnimal interface, you can define the function once as follows:

```
public void RunThenWalk(IAnimal a) {
    a.Run();
    a.Walk();
}
```

By programming against the interface, you are essentially trusting the classes to implement the intent of the interface. So in our example, the thought is "I don't care how they Run and Walk, so long as they Run and Walk. My RunThenWalk will be valid as long as they fulfill that agreement. It functions perfectly well without knowing anything else about the class."

The full example looks like this:

```
// Interface defining a contract
interface IAnimal {
    void Run();
    void Walk();
}

// Implementations of the interface
class Monkey implements IAnimal {
    public void Run() { System.out.println("Monkey runs swiftly!"); }
    public void Walk() { System.out.println("Monkey walks on all fours!"); }
}

class Dog implements IAnimal {
    public void Run() { System.out.println("Dog sprints fast!"); }
    public void Walk() { System.out.println("Dog trots steadily!"); }
}

// Some Main class could define a function like RunThenWalk which relies on the IAnimal interface
public class Main {
    public void RunThenWalk(IAnimal a) {
        a.Run();
        a.Walk();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Monkey monkey = new Monkey();
        Dog dog = new Dog();

        RunThenWalk(monkey); // Works!
        RunThenWalk(dog);    // Works!
    }
}
```
