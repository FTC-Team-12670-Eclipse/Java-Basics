# Understanding Inheritance in Java

## Imagine a Family
Think about how you inherit traits from your parents. For example:
- If your parent can drive a car, you might learn to drive too.
- If your parent has brown eyes, you might have brown eyes too.

In programming, **inheritance** works the same way! A class (child) can inherit properties and methods from another class (parent), so you don‚Äôt have to write the same code again.

## Example: Animals and Dogs üêæ
Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre creating a program with animals. You start with a general blueprint (class) for **Animals**. Then you create a more specific blueprint (class) for **Dogs**.

Instead of rewriting everything for dogs, you make the Dog class **inherit** from the Animal class. Dogs get all the features of Animals for free, and you can also add features that only dogs have (like barking).

## Java Code: Animals and Dogs

```java
// Parent class: Animal
class Animal {
    // Properties: What all animals have
    String name;

    // Constructor: To create an animal
    Animal(String animalName) {
        name = animalName;
    }

    // Method: What all animals can do
    void eat() {
        System.out.println(name + " is eating.");
    }
}

// Child class: Dog (inherits from Animal)
class Dog extends Animal {
    // Additional method: What only dogs can do
    Dog(String dogName) {
        super(dogName); // Call the parent class's constructor
    }

    void bark() {
        System.out.println(name + " says: Woof!");
    }
}

// The actual program
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create an Animal object
        Animal tiger = new Animal("Tiger");
        tiger.eat(); // Tiger is eating.

        // Create a Dog object
        Dog buddy = new Dog("Buddy");
        buddy.eat(); // Buddy is eating. (inherited from Animal)
        buddy.bark(); // Buddy says: Woof!
    }
}
