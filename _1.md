# Understanding Classes and Objects in Java

## Imagine a Blueprint
A **class** is like a blueprint for a house. It tells you how to build the house (how many rooms, what color the walls are, etc.), but it‚Äôs not the actual house. You can use the blueprint to build as many houses as you want.

An **object** is the actual house you build using the blueprint. Each house is based on the same blueprint, but you can decorate it differently.

## Example: Blueprints for Cats üê±
Imagine you want to create cats in your program. You‚Äôd start by making a blueprint (class) for a cat. It would describe what every cat can do (like meow) and what every cat has (like a name and age).

## Java Code: Cats in Action

```java
// The blueprint for a Cat
class Cat {
    // Properties: What a cat has
    String name;
    int age;

    // Constructor: How to create a new cat
    Cat(String catName, int catAge) {
        name = catName;
        age = catAge;
    }

    // Method: What a cat can do
    void meow() {
        System.out.println(name + " says: Meow!");
    }

    void displayInfo() {
        System.out.println("Name: " + name + ", Age: " + age);
    }
}

// The actual program
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create objects (actual cats)
        Cat fluffy = new Cat("Fluffy", 3);
        Cat whiskers = new Cat("Whiskers", 5);

        // Use the objects
        fluffy.meow(); // Fluffy says: Meow!
        whiskers.displayInfo(); // Name: Whiskers, Age: 5
    }
}
